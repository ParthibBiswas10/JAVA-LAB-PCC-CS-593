1. Definition
An instance variable is a variable that belongs to one specific object (instance) of a class.
Every object you create gets its own copy of that variable in memory.

2. Static vs. Instance
Static variable â†’ shared by all objects (only one copy in memory, belongs to the class).
Instance variable â†’ each object has its own copy (belongs to the object/instance).

ðŸ’¡ Shortcut rule:

If a variable should have different values for different objects â†’ instance variable.
If a variable is the same for all objects â†’ static variable.
